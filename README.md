Round Robin with and without priority
Round_Robin.c contains the code for implementing the round robin algorithm in which after a particular time Quantum the process preemption
occurs and the next process gets the chance to use the CPU.This kind of algorithm reduces starvation(if the Time Quantum is not too large)



In Priority_round_robin.cpp the code contains code which implements priority based Round robin algo
